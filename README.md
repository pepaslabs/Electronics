# Electronics
A central place to organize and publish all of my hobbyist electronics knowledge and projects.

## Wiki

My first attempt at curating this clump of electronics knowledge was this [wiki](https://github.com/pepaslabs/Electronics/wiki).

## EEVBlog threads of interest

- [UT61E drift and recalibration](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/ut61e-drift-and-recalibration/)
  - [This post](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/ut61e-drift-and-recalibration/msg345532/#msg345532) describes replacing the built-in vref (75ppm/C) with the LT1790 (5ppm/C).

## "Awesome" lists

Github users have started an awesome tradition of curating lists of "awesome" links.
